# Mini Challenge 3 - Asking Questions
# Project will ask user 4 different questions and store the answers into 4 different strings and it will print it back out to them in various sentences in the terminal. Errors will pop up if they enter in numbers.

# Peer Review: Isaiah Ferguson
The program works smoothly might want to change the loop to prevent double erros such as intering two ints back to back. The Prompt questions are really funny! I like the use of 'name' at the end of the program it felt intimate. I enjoyed the program overall!!
